Notes:
    - Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
    - Insertion sort works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game.
Time Complexity:
    - Best	O(n)
    - Worst	O(n2)
    - Average	O(n2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
