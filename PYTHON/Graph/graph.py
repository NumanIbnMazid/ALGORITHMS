Notes:
    - A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.
    - Every relationship is and edge from one node to another.
    - Facebook uses graph data structure to store it's data.
    - A graph is a data structure (V, E) that consists of
        * V: A collection of vertices V.
        * E: A collection of edges E, represented as ordered pairs of vertices (u, v).
Terminologies:
    - Adjacency: A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them.
    - Path: A sequence of edges that allows you to go from vertex A to vertex B is called a path.
    - Directed Graph: A graph in which an edge (u, v) doesn't necessarily mean that there is an edge (v, u) as well. The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge.
Operations:
    - Check if the element present in the graph.
    - Graph Traversal.
    - Add elements (vertex, edges) to graph.
    - Find the path from one vertex to another.
