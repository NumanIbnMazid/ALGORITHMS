Keywords: Non-linear Data Structure, Connected Nodes, Connected by Edges
Terminologies:
    * Node: An entity that contains a key or value and pointers to it's child nodes. The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes. The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.
    * Edge: Link between any two nodes.
    * Root: Top most node of a tree.
    * Height of a Node: The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node)
    * Depth of a node: The deepth of a node the number of edges from the root to the node.
    * Height of a tree: The height of a tree is the height of the root node or the deepth of the deepest node.
    * Degree of a node: The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.
    * Forest: A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.
Types of Trees:
    * Binary Tree
    * Binary Search Tree
    * AVL Tree
    * B-Tree
