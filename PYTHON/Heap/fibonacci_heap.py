"""
Notes:
    - Follows Min Heap or Max Heap Property.
    - Can have more than two children or no children at all.
    - More efficient Heap Operations than Binomial and Binary Heaps.
    - Trees within a Fibonacci Heap are unordered but rooted.
    - Child nodes of a parent node are connected to each other through a circular doubly linked list.
Time Complexity:
    - Deleting Node: O(1)
    - Concatening: O(1)
